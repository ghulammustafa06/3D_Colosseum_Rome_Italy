                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an ancient Roman structure located in the heart of Rome, Italy. It was commissioned in AD 72 by Emperor Vespasian and completed in AD 80 by his son Titus. The Colosseum was built on the site of Nero's Golden House, reflecting a shift from the extravagant rule of Nero to the more public-focused governance of the Flavian dynasty. The amphitheater was primarily used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. It could hold between 50,000 to 80,000 spectators, making it one of the largest amphitheaters ever built.</p>

                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <p>The Colosseum is an elliptical structure made of concrete and sand, standing four stories high at approximately 50 meters (164 feet). The exterior walls are divided into four levels, the first three featuring arched entrances supported by semi-circular columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, respectively. The fourth level is adorned with rectangular windows and Corinthian pilasters. The arena floor was made of wood and covered with sand, concealing a complex network of underground tunnels and chambers (the hypogeum) used to house animals, slaves, and gladiators before contests. The Colosseum also featured a sophisticated system of ramps, elevators, and trapdoors to facilitate the movement of performers and scenery.</p>

                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>The Colosseum hosted a variety of events, the most famous of which were the gladiator battles. These contests involved trained fighters, often slaves or prisoners of war, who fought to the death for the entertainment of the Roman public. Animal hunts, known as venationes, featured exotic animals from across the Roman Empire, including lions, elephants, and bears. Naumachiae, or mock sea battles, were occasionally staged by flooding the arena. Public executions were also a common spectacle, with condemned criminals facing wild beasts or being forced to reenact mythological stories. Additionally, the Colosseum served as a venue for theatrical performances and re-enactments of famous battles.</p>
